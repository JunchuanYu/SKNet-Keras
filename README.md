# SKNet-Keras

Simple tensorflow-keras implementation of SKConv in [Selective Kernel Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06586.pdf) 

## Approach

## Notes

I find there are many implementations of SKNet:

- implus/SKNet [[official code](https://github.com/implus/SKNet)] [caffe]
- pppLang/SKNet [[code](https://github.com/pppLang/SKNet)] [pytorch]
- bravotty/*SKNet*-tensorflow [[code](https://github.com/bravotty/SKNet-tensorflow)] [tensorflow]
-  ...

By comparing with the official code, these third-party implementations have slight differences in details. So I present my own implementation in this repository.

If you see *any* fault, please let me know.
